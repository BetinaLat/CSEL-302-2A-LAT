# CSEL302-Introduction to Intelligent Systems

# Activities and Project Compilation

## Introduction

Welcome to my compilation of activities in CSEL 302. Within these pages, you'll discover my journey through various projects and activites aimed at honing my skills in deciphering data. From simple analyses to more complex investigations, each project represents a step forward in my understanding of the Data Analysis and Visualization, Probability & Statistics, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression.

##  Data Analysis and Visualization

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data collection is the process of gathering information. This information could be anything from survey responses and observations to measurements and interviews.
Data preprocessing is the process of getting your data ready for analysis or machine learning by cleaning, organizing, and formatting it.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is acritical process in data analysis, and it serves as the initial step before diving into more in-depth analysis or modeling. 

### Data Visualization Tools
1. Matplotlib
2. Seaborn

### Basic Visualization Types
1. Line charts
2. Bar graphs
3. Scatter plots

## Probability and Statistics

Probability implies 'likelihood' or 'chance'. When an event is certain to happen then the probability of occurrence of that event is 1 and when it is certain that the event cannot happen then the probability of that event is 0.

In statistics, we use various measures to summarize and describe data. 

Four fundamental measures are:

Mean (Average): It's the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
Median: It's the middle value when data is sorted, or the average of the two middle values if there's an even number of values.
Variance: It quantifies the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean.
Standard Deviation: It's the square root of the variance and measures the average deviation from the mean.

Data Visualizations can reveal patterns, trends, and insights that might be hard to see in raw data.

## Linear Regression
A statistical method used in the field of data analysis and predictive modeling. It's particularly useful in understanding and modeling relationships between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors). 

## Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical technique used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Assessment Task 4 Predicting Grades using Linear Regression

Activity: Predicting Student Grades
Objective:
Implement a linear regression model to predict student grades based on different academic and nonacademic factors.

## Assessment Task 5 Bank Customer

Objective:
Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and account
information using logistic regression.

## Assessment Task 6 Online Food Order Analysis
Assessment Task: Predicting Feedback on Online Food Orders Using Logistic Regression
Objective: Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization. 

## Assessment Task 7 Netflix Userbase Analysis

Objective:
Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based
on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass
data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Midterm Exam Assessment Task

Diabetes Dataset
• Description: Comprises diagnostic measurements for a set of patients diagnosed with diabetes.
• Use Case: Suitable for both Linear Regression (predicting a quantitative measure of disease
progression) and Logistic Regression (classifying patients into categories based on diagnostic
measurements).


# Conclusion
As I conlcude this compilations of activities in data analysis, I'm grateful for the opportunities to delve into the world of numbers and insights. These projects have been instrumental in expanding my understanding of data's significance in today's landscape. Looking ahead, I'm excited to apply what I've learned and continue exploring the endless possibilities within this field.
